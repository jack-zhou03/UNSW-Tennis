                <br/>
                If you have symptoms of “tennis elbow” (see last edition of the 
                newsletter), it is important to start taking some actions before 
                it becomes chronic........ Here are some simple, do it yourself 
                tips:</p>
              <br/>
              <br/> <table cellpadding="3" border="0">
                <tr valign="top">
                  <td>1.</td>
                  <td align="justify">Cryotherapy – just a fancy medical term 
                    for topical application of ice. Tenderness and / or pain in 
                    the wrist extensor muscles, their common tendon or the elbow 
                    bone (epicondyle) may indicate an inflammatory process. Applying 
                    ice to these tender areas will help reduce inflammation and 
                    therefore encourage the healing process. Apply ice for 5 minutes 
                    at a time, rest for 5 minutes and repeat this process 2-3 
                    times. At the end of this, the skin should be cool to touch 
                    and slightly red. I would encourage everybody who plays tennis 
                    regularly to ice their elbows after a game of tennis.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr valign="top">
                  <td>2.</td>
                  <td align="justify">Stretch the wrist extensor muscles regularly. 
                    Regular stretching encourages optimal flexibility and will 
                    reduce the risk of injury caused by eccentric loading (when 
                    the muscles are forced to stretch and contract at the same 
                    time). To stretch the wrist extensors, simply make a loose 
                    fist with one hand (the wrist to be stretched) and use the 
                    opposite hand to bend the loose fist and wrist down. Hold 
                    this position while slowing straighten the elbow. Hold this 
                    position for 15-20 secs, and repeat 3-4 times.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr valign="top">
                  <td>3.</td>
                  <td align="justify">Perform proper warm up exercises before 
                    playing tennis. Warm up exercises can improve range of movement 
                    about a joint by raising body temperature. Warm up can be 
                    achieved by applying a hot pack to the joint or muscles for 
                    5- 10 mins, or by performing small active movements, such 
                    as circular movements of the wrist, bending and straightening 
                    the elbow and wrist, or light jog around the court!</td>
                </tr>
                <tr valign="top">
                  <td>4.</td>
                  <td align="justify">Modify activities of everyday living which 
                    involved repetitive use of the wrist extensors. This included 
                    use of computer mouse, typing on laptop, painting and cutting 
                    etc. By adopting a better ergonomic work environment, you 
                    will substantially reduce the risk of tennis elbow.</td>

              </table>
              <br/> <p>Finally, if you have symptoms of tennis elbow for longer 
                than 3 months, you must consult your local physiotherapists and 
                get it checked out! </p>

              Michael Lee</a> - June 2010<br/> <p align="justify"><b>If I play 
                tennis, will I get tennis elbow?</b><br/>
                <br/>
                If you play tennis regularly, you are at risk of developing “tennis 
                elbow”.....unfortunately..... What is “tennis elbow”? Well, “tennis 
                elbow” refers to a medical condition which involves inflammation 
                of the wrist extensor muscles (forearm muscles that bend your 
                wrist backwards) and their common tendon which attaches to the 
                outside of your elbow bone (epicondyle). Symptoms of tennis elbow 
                include pain and swelling around the epicondyle, “weakness” and/or 
                pain with gripping (e.g., holding a tennis racket). Tennis elbow 
                is typically caused by repetitive, forceful bending movements 
                of the wrist (single-handed back hand in tennis is a good example), 
                which leads to recurrent inflammation of the wrist/forearm muscles 
                and their common tendon. However, interestingly, not everybody 
                who suffers from tennis elbow play tennis! In fact, clinically, 
                we see more non-tennis players with tennis elbow than tennis players! 
                So why is this? The truth is, activities which involved repetitive 
                use of the finger muscles (e.g., typing on a laptop, clicking 
                on computer mouse) can also cause repetitive strain and subsequently 
                inflammation of the same wrist/forearm muscles that give rise 
                to “tennis elbow”! In addition, people who are required to do 
                a lot lifting, painting, packaging and cutting movements at work 
                are more prone to developing tennis elbows. As you can start to 
                appreciate, there are many factors that can contribute to tennis 
                elbow. If your work or occupation involved prolonged use of computer 
                and/or repetitive wrist movements and you are a keen tennis player, 
                you are more likely to get tennis elbow.........Don’t despair, 
                in the next issue, I will give you some tips on how to prevent 
                tennis elbow as well as some advice on what to do IF you already 
                have tennis elbow. </p>
