        <p><u>UNSW Tennis Club Championship</u></p>
        <p>This is our largest annual internal competition. Just like any of the

          run Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles and 
          Mixed Doubles. Each of them have the same format with the group stages 
          kicking off and group toppers advance to knockout rounds.</p>

        <p><u>Eastern Suburb Tennis Competition</u></p>
        <p>The Eastern Suburbs Tennis Association organises three competitions each year, played in a round robin format over 10 weeks, plus semi-finals and finals. Two types of competitions make up the event &minus; Saturday afternoon mixed doubles competition and Sunday morning singles/doubles competitions. All competitions are team-based, and arranged in grades of roughly 6 teams of the same standard.</p>

<p>The Saturday afternoon mixed competition is a purely doubles competition, played on Saturday afternoons. The competition plays from 1pm to 5pm, starting with 1 mens doubles set, then 1 womens doubles set and finally 4 mixed doubles sets with each pair playing two sets each. Four players would be required to play each week (two guys and two girls), although it is recommended to have a few more players to sustain the team throughout the competition. So the team plays 6 sets in total, with each person playing 3 sets of doubles each. This is a very social competition, played with a lot of fun and competitive spirit, and many teams bring food and drinks to serve up throughout the afternoon.</p>

<p>The Sunday morning singles/doubles competitions are more competitive. Only two players are required to play each week, and play on Sunday mornings from 8:00am to 10am or 10am to 12noon. There are a lot of grades and teams in the Sunday morning competitions, so the time that you play depends on what time you want to wake up on Sunday morning, as each timeslot has roughly the same number of teams of a similar standard. The majority of UNSW teams play in the Sunday morning competitions.</p>

<p>The teams in either the 8am to 10am competition may be made up of up to 4 players of any gender. The format is that the first set is a doubles set, and then each player plays a set of singles, and finally a second doubles set is played again if there is still time. So each team plays 4 sets, and each person plays 3 sets of tennis, so it&rsquo;s a great way to wake up on a Sunday morning.</p>

<p>The competitions are very popular, with some players even playing in the competitions for over 20 years!</p>

<p>If you have any questions, are interested in playing, or would like to be a reserve for one of the current teams, please send me an email at <a href="mailto:tennis@unsw.edu.au?subject=ESTC">

<p>See you on the court!<br/>

        <p><u>Intervarsity Competition</u></p>
        <p>The various intervarsity games provide the opportunity for athletes 
          to compete against athletes from other universities in Australia. The 
          first major intervarsity games for us will be the Eastern University 
          Games, where we will compete against other universities in Eastern Australia. 
          A good performance will qualify us for the Australian University Games, 
          where the best performing universities from all of Australia will battle 
          for the glory of their alma mater. What this also means for individual 
          players are scholarship opportunities as well as a chance at exposure 
          to national- or even professional-level sport.</p>
