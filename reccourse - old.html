				<h2>Cardio Tennis</h2>
				<br/>
				<p align="justify">Cardio Tennis is a fun, social, group tennis-fitness program for people of all fitness levels and tennis abilities. It&#39;s more about getting a great, high-energy workout than pure tennis technique. Constant movement is the focus as participants are guided through a series of fun and heart-pumping drills. Participants wear heart rate monitors, exercise to music, use low-compression balls and a variety of equipment, including agility ladders.
				All equipment provided except Heart Rate Monitors. It is recommended you bring your own HR Monitor. HR Monitor can be purchased at a discounted rate through the instructor.
				<br/><br/>
				All instructors are Tennis Australia Qualified Coaches as well as Registered Cardio Tennis Coaches.
				<br/><br/>
				Note: Cardio Tennis is a fitness class focusing on high-energy workout instead of technical fundamentals. Participants looking for improving their tennis skills should enrol in the Beginner&#39;s Class.
				<br/><br/>
