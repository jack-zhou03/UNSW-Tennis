									<p align="justify"><b>Management of tennis elbow</b><br><br>									
									If you have symptoms of “tennis elbow” (see last edition of the newsletter), it is important to start taking some actions before it becomes chronic........ Here are some simple, do it yourself tips:
								<br><br>
								<table cellpadding="3" border="0">
								<tr valign="top"><td>1.</td><td align="justify">Cryotherapy – just a fancy medical term for topical application of ice. Tenderness and / or pain in the wrist extensor muscles, their common tendon or the elbow bone (epicondyle) may indicate an inflammatory process. Applying ice to these tender areas will help reduce inflammation and therefore encourage the healing process. Apply ice for 5 minutes at a time, rest for 5 minutes and repeat this process 2-3 times. At the end of this, the skin should be cool to touch and slightly red. I would encourage everybody who plays tennis regularly to ice their elbows after a game of tennis.</td></tr>
								<tr valign="top"><td>2.</td><td align="justify">Stretch the wrist extensor muscles regularly. Regular stretching encourages optimal flexibility and will reduce the risk of injury caused by eccentric loading (when the muscles are forced to stretch and contract at the same time). To stretch the wrist extensors, simply make a loose fist with one hand (the wrist to be stretched) and use the opposite hand to bend the loose fist and wrist down. Hold this position while slowing straighten the elbow. Hold this position for 15-20 secs, and repeat 3-4 times.</td></tr>
								<tr valign="top"><td>3.</td><td align="justify">Perform proper warm up exercises before playing tennis. Warm up exercises can improve range of movement about a joint by raising body temperature. Warm up can be achieved by applying a hot pack to the joint or muscles for 5- 10 mins, or by performing small active movements, such as circular movements of the wrist, bending and straightening the elbow and wrist, or light jog around the court!</td></tr>
								<tr valign="top"><td>4.</td><td align="justify">Modify activities of everyday living which involved repetitive use of the wrist extensors. This included use of computer mouse, typing on laptop, painting and cutting etc. By adopting a better ergonomic work environment, you will substantially reduce the risk of tennis elbow.</td></tr>
								<tr valign="top"><td>5.</td><td align="justify">Have a tennis coach check your swing and gripping techniques.</td></tr>
								</table>
								<br>
								Finally, if you have symptoms of tennis elbow for longer than 3 months, you must consult your local physiotherapists and get it checked out!

									<p align="justify"><b>If I play tennis, will I get tennis elbow?</b><br><br>									
									If you play tennis regularly, you are at risk of developing “tennis elbow”.....unfortunately..... What is “tennis elbow”? Well, “tennis elbow” refers to a medical condition which involves inflammation of the wrist extensor muscles (forearm muscles that bend your wrist backwards) and their common tendon which attaches to the outside of your elbow bone (epicondyle). Symptoms of tennis elbow include pain and swelling around the epicondyle, “weakness” and/or pain with gripping (e.g., holding a tennis racket). Tennis elbow is typically caused by repetitive, forceful bending movements of the wrist (single-handed back hand in tennis is a good example), which leads to recurrent inflammation of the wrist/forearm muscles and their common tendon. However, interestingly, not everybody who suffers from tennis elbow play tennis! In fact, clinically, we see more non-tennis players with tennis elbow than tennis players! So why is this? The truth is, activities which involved repetitive use of the finger muscles (e.g., typing on a laptop, clicking on computer mouse) can also cause repetitive strain and subsequently inflammation of the same wrist/forearm muscles that give rise to “tennis elbow”! In addition, people who are required to do a lot lifting, painting, packaging and cutting movements at work are more prone to developing tennis elbows. As you can start to appreciate, there are many factors that can contribute to tennis elbow. If your work or occupation involved prolonged use of computer and/or repetitive wrist movements and you are a keen tennis player, you are more likely to get tennis elbow.........Don’t despair, in the next issue, I will give you some tips on how to prevent tennis elbow as well as some advice on what to do IF you already have tennis elbow.
