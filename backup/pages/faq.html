									<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><br>
									<p><u>Where and when can I sign up for membership?</u>
									<br><br>
									Go to the sign up section of this website, although the best way to sign up would be to turn up at any social tennis session and speak to the person in charge.<br><br>
									Download the membership form <a href="/data/Member Form 2010.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and then submit it in person at any social tennis session.
									</p>
									<hr>
									<p><u>How much do I need to pay?</u>
									<br><br>
									Click <a href="/data/2010-11 Membership Fee.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for the latest membership fee structure. Please note that we reserve the right to update the fee structure without prior notice.
									<br>For any query, feel free to approach the person in charge at any of our social tennis sessions.
									</p>
									<hr>
									<p><u>How can I help the Tennis Club?</u>
									<br><br>
									You can approach any one of the current executive committee (preferably the president) to offer your services to the club, no matter how remote you might think your talents are. We could always do with more helping hands.
									</p>
									<hr>									
									<p><u>Do Tennis Club members get discounted court hire?</u>
									<br><br>
									As the Tennis Club itself does not receive a discount from the Fitness and Aquatic Centre for court hire, we unfortunately cannot offer our members discounted court hire at the university. However, we can offer our members discounted court hire at the Moore Park Tennis Centre, which are in much better condition and have some of the best lights in the Eastern Suburbs.
									</p>
									<hr>
									<p><u>What do I do if I don't own a racquet?</u>
									<br><br>
									We offer racquets for hire during social tennis session on Sunday at Moore Park for as little as $2 per day. Approach any of the committee members during the social tennis session for more information.
									</p>
									<hr>
									<p><u>I am a beginner, how can I get some coaching?</u>
									<br><br>
									The Sport and Recreation Centre offers tennis recreation course for beginners during all academic sessions. Click <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sportandrec.unsw.edu.au/recreationalcourses/ballsports">here</a> for more information.
									</p>
									<hr>
									<p><u>I can’t stay for the whole 5 hours for social tennis, can I still play?</u>
									<br><br>
									You can come and leave anytime you like between 2pm and 7pm during our social tennis session. However, full fee still applies.
