											<p><b>2. How it works</b></p>
											<p align="justify">It is the time when our Club members and casual visitors come together to play social tennis. It is also a great opportunity to meet new friends and to have fun.</p>
											<p align="justify">Since the number of players turning up is almost always more than what the courts could accommodate, we may need to take turns to use the court. One set of Doubles (uni-sex) will be played after a few minutes warm-up. Once the set finishes, the next four players currently waiting will take over and play their set.</p>
											<p align="justify">There are Social Directors around and they will help assigning players onto the courts. Please follow their instructions.</p>

											<p align="justify">Our Social Tennis is open to all UNSW students, staffs, alumni and the general public. However, members of the UNSW Tennis Club will enjoy a discount off the normal social rate (see Section 4 below).</p>
											<p align="justify">You may sign up on the spot during Social Tennis. Membership Fee is per annum and reduced on a pro-rata basis. (See tables below) Please note that we accept cash only.</p>

											<p><b>7. FAQ about Social Tennis</b></p>
											<table cellpadding="3" border="0" cellspacing="0">
											<tr><td valign="top">(1)</td><td><i>Q</i><font color="#FF0000">: How do I become a member?</font><br>
											<i>A</i>: Please fill in the club membership application form which can be accessed <a href="/data/UNSW Tennis Club Membership Form.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and return to any of the committee members during Sunday social tennis.</td></tr>
											<tr><td valign="top">(2)</td><td><i>Q</i><font color="#FF0000">: What should I do if I want to attend Social Tennis?</font><br>
											<i>A</i>: Just <b>bring your tennis gear and fees</b> (in cash), and show up on the tennis courts. No advance booking is needed. Tennis balls will be provided.</td></tr>
											<tr><td valign="top">(3)</td><td><i>Q</i><font color="#FF0000">: What if I don't have a racquet?</font><br>
											<i>A</i>: Limited racquets are available to rent. Rental fee is $5 per day.</td></tr>
											<tr><td valign="top">(4)</td><td><i>Q</i><font color="#FF0000">: Do I need to be a member to attend Social Tennis?</font><br>

											<tr><td valign="top">(5)</td><td><i>Q</i><font color="#FF0000">: With whom will I play?</font><br>											
											<i>A</i>: You'll play with players of different levels from beginners to advanced players.</td></tr>
											<tr><td valign="top">(6)</td><td><i>Q</i><font color="#FF0000">: Is there a coach on the court? Will I get any coaching during Social Tennis?</font><br>
											<i>A</i>: Since it is "social" tennis, <b>there wouldn't be any training provided</b>. If you are a total beginner or just have a little experience playing tennis, we suggest you enrol in a tennis class in which you will learn the basic techniques. The UNSW Sport & Recreation is running Recreation Courses for beginners during the university semesters. For more info check out their website <a href="http://www.sportandrec.unsw.edu.au" target="_blank">here</a></td></tr>
											<tr><td valign="top">(7)</td><td><i>Q</i><font color="#FF0000">: I know Sunday Social Tennis starts at 2pm. What if I can't make 2pm?</font><br>

											<tr><td valign="top">(9)</td><td><i>Q</i><font color="#FF0000">: How long or how many sets can I play when it's my turn to use the court?</font><br>											
											<i>A</i>: If there isn't anyone waiting, you may stay on the court for as long as you like. If there are players waiting, you have to start a set -- <b>one normal set</b> with tie-break at 6 games all -- after a few minutes warm-up. Once finished you need to vacate the court for the next players to get on. Please note that when there are many players queuing up, our Social Director may ask you to play a shorter set, that is, <b>a total of eight games</b>.</td></tr>
											<tr><td valign="top">(10)</td><td><i>Q</i><font color="#FF0000">: What if I just want to have a hit instead of playing games?</font><br>
											<i>A</i>: Sometimes some players prefer having a hit instead of starting a set. In this case four of you (already on the court) have to agree on it. You may use the court for <b>half an hour</b>.</td></tr>
											<tr><td valign="top">(11)</td><td><i>Q</i><font color="#FF0000">: Can I play Singles during Social Tennis session?</font><br>											
											<i>A</i>: Singles games are allowed when no other players are waiting for the court. Please keep in mind that if there are other players starting to queue up for the court, please <b>stop the game immediately</b>, and let those players join you for a Doubles game.</td></tr>
 											<tr><td valign="top">(12)</td><td><i>Q</i><font color="#FF0000">: What if I broke my string? Is there re-stringing service available?</font><br>
