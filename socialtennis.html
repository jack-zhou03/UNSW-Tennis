          <p><b>2. How it works</b></p>
          <p align="justify">It is the time when our Club members and casual visitors
            come together to play social tennis. It is also a great opportunity
            to meet new friends and to have fun.</p>
          <p align="justify">Since the number of players turning up is almost
            always more than what the courts could accommodate, we may need to
            take turns to use the court. One set of Doubles (uni-sex) will be
            played after a few minutes warm-up. Once the set finishes, the next
            four players currently waiting will take over and play their set.</p>
          <p align="justify">There are Social Directors around and they will help
            assigning players onto the courts. Please follow their instructions.</p>
            
          <p>Starting from Thursday 17 March social session will now run in 2.5 hour blocks with limited places so that everyone gets a decent amount of hitting time. Electronic booking and payment system will be used to reserve your spot. To book your spot please click this link below:</p> 
            <a href="http://unswtennis.simplybook.me/" target="_blank"><h1>unswtennis.simplybook.me</h1></a>
          
          <p>Bookings can be made up to 2 weeks in advance.</p>
 
<p>Once you've booked in for a time slot, you are required to attend the full 2.5 hours session.</p>
 
<p>Cancellations must be made at least 24 hours prior commencement of social tennis, no refund will be given for cancellations less than 24 hours.</p>

                Since it is "social" tennis, <b>there wouldn't be any training
                provided</b>. If you are a total beginner or just have a little
                experience playing tennis, we suggest you enrol in a tennis class
                in which you will learn the basic techniques. The UNSW Sport &amp;
                Recreation is running Recreation Courses for beginners during
                the university semesters. For more info check out their website
                <a href="http://www.sportandrec.unsw.edu.au/recreationalcourses/ballsports" target="_blank">here</a></td>

                If there isn't anyone waiting, you may stay on the court for as
                long as you like. If there are players waiting, you have to start
                a set -- <b>one normal set</b> with tie-break at 6 games all --
                after a few minutes warm-up. Once finished you need to vacate
                the court for the next players to get on. At times <strong>fast-four format</strong> may be used.</td>

                some players prefer having a hit instead of starting a set. In
                this case four of you (already on the court) have to agree on
                it. You may use the court for <b>half an hour</b>.</td>

                when no other players are waiting for the court. Please keep in
                mind that if there are other players starting to queue up for
